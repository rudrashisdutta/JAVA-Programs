# `JAVA PROGRAMS`

## `ABOUT`

This repository contains almost all the `basic` programs that I have created using JAVA. It also includes the programs from my [University](https://kiit.ac.in/) LABS, and the ones I practiced or tested certain things on.

##

## `PLATFORM`

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Editor was used to create these programs.  
The Applets were designed on [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/), which are present here -> [APPLETS](APPLETS/BLUEJ).
