###### Question8: [```Answer8```](Q8.java)
    ✨Write a program in Java that reads a number from the user and then displays the Hailstone sequence for that number.
       The problem can be expressed as follows:
        . Pick an integer, let x
        . If x is even, divide it by two
        . If x is odd, multiply it by three and add one
        . Continue this process until x is equal to one (1).
       Ex: Let x=5
        5 is odd, so I make 3n+1: 16
        16 is even, so I take half: 8
        8 is even, so I take half: 4
        4 is even, so I take half: 2
        2 is even, so I take half: 1
        There are total 5 steps to reach 1.
